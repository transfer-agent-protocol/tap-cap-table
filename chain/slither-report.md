# Slither Analysis Report

Generated by [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) v0.11.5

## Summary

| Severity | Count |

| High | 0 |

| Low | 3 |
| Informational | 0 |

**Contracts analyzed**: 31
**Detectors run**: 98

## Findings

### Low Severity

#### L-1: Reentrancy (Benign) in `createCapTable`

**Location**: `src/CapTableFactory.sol#21-29`

**Description**: State variable written after external call.

```solidity
// External call
capTableProxy = new BeaconProxy(address(capTableBeacon), initializationData)

// State variable written after
capTableProxies.push(address(capTableProxy))
```

**Status**: Acceptable - This is a benign reentrancy. The `BeaconProxy` constructor is trusted (OpenZeppelin) and the state update is append-only to a tracking array. No funds or critical state at risk.

#### L-2: Reentrancy (Events) in `createCapTable`

**Location**: `src/CapTableFactory.sol#21-29`

**Description**: Event emitted after external call.

```solidity
// External call
capTableProxy = new BeaconProxy(address(capTableBeacon), initializationData)

// Event emitted after
emit CapTableCreated(address(capTableProxy))
```

**Status**: Acceptable - Event ordering after external call is intentional. The event needs the proxy address which is only available after deployment.

#### L-3: Reentrancy (Events) in `updateCapTableImplementation`

**Location**: `src/CapTableFactory.sol#33-41`

**Description**: Event emitted after external call.

```solidity
// External call
capTableBeacon.upgradeTo(newImplementation)

// Event emitted after
emit CapTableImplementationUpdated(oldImplementation, newImplementation)
```

**Status**: Acceptable - Event is emitted after the upgrade completes successfully. This is the correct pattern - emit event after state change is confirmed.

## Configuration

Slither was run with the following configuration (`slither.config.json`):

- **Filtered paths**: `node_modules`, `test`, `script`, `lib`, `out`, `cache`
- **Excluded detectors**: `solc-version`, `naming-convention`, `assembly`
- **Dependencies excluded**: Yes

## Notes

All 3 findings are low-severity reentrancy warnings related to event emission and state updates after external calls. These are acceptable patterns in this context:

1. The `BeaconProxy` is a trusted OpenZeppelin contract
2. The factory is `onlyOwner` protected
3. State updates are append-only (tracking arrays) or confirmed upgrades
4. Events logically need to be emitted after the operations complete
