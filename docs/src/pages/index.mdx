# Transfer Agent Protocol

We use [Open Cap Table Format](/protocol/tap-ocf) and convert it into a smart contracts. This creates a full cap table onchain and offchain. The onchain cap table is the source of truth and the offchain cap table is its mirror.

<Callout emoji="⏳">This documentation is currently in public preview</Callout>

## Current Status

The protocol is live on [Plume Mainnet](https://docs.plumenetwork.xyz/plume/developer-resources/network-parameters).

<Callout type="info">
Contract addresses are unique to each deployment. When you deploy the factory, you'll get your own addresses. See the [Development Guide](/development) to get started.

## Protocol Specification

The protocol has three major components.

- [Smart contracts](/protocol/tap-cap-table) create primary ownership records onchain first. These records are then synced with the offchain database.

- [Offchain database](/protocol/tap-ocf) stores the cap table data. We're currently using a MongoDB that stores cap table data in the [Open Cap Table Format](/protocol/tap-ocf).

- [Server](https://github.com/transfer-agent-protocol/tap-cap-table/tree/main/src/routes) that interacts with both the smart contracts and the offchain database. This server is responsible for syncing the data between the two.
