# Security Toolchain

[![Security Scans](https://github.com/transfer-agent-protocol/tap-cap-table/actions/workflows/security.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/transfer-agent-protocol/tap-cap-table/actions/workflows/security.yml)

**Verify locally:** `make security && make test-invariant` — should pass with 0 high findings.

## Current Status

| Tool | High | Medium | Low | Status |
|------|------|--------|-----|--------|
| Aderyn | 0 | 0 | 5 | ✅ All acceptable |
| Slither | 0 | 0 | 3 | ✅ All acceptable |
| Invariant Tests | - | - | - | ✅ 7 passing |
| Unit Tests | - | - | - | ✅ All passing |

## Tools

### Aderyn
Real-time static linting. Fast feedback while coding.

### Slither
Deeper static analysis (taint tracking, control-flow). CI fails on high severity.

### Foundry Invariant Tests
Stateful fuzzing for core accounting rules (256 runs / 50 depth).

**Invariants tested:**
- `shares_issued <= shares_authorized` (issuer and stock classes)
- Stakeholder/stock class index mapping consistency
- Count consistency between contract and tracked state
- Stock class authorized never exceeds issuer authorized

### Unit Tests
Tests covering core flows, edge cases, access control, factory logic, and operator role verification. All passing.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make test` | Run all unit tests |
| `make test-invariant` | Short invariant fuzz (256 runs, 50 depth) |
| `make test-invariant-deep` | Deep invariant fuzz (2000 runs, 100 depth) |
| `make aderyn` | Run Aderyn → `report.md` |
| `make slither` | Run Slither → `chain/slither-report.md` |
| `make security` | Run aderyn + slither |

## Philosophy

- Catch obvious stuff early (Aderyn)
- Dig deeper statically (Slither)
- Stress-test logic over sequences (Invariants)
- Verify specific behaviors & errors (Unit tests)
- Pre-audit cleanup → reduces noise for auditors
- No single tool replaces a full audit
