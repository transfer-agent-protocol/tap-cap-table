# Transfer Stock

Transfer shares from one stakeholder to another. The recipient (transferee) must already exist on the cap table before you can transfer stock to them.

<Steps>

### Create the transferee stakeholder

Before transferring, ensure the recipient exists. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8293/stakeholder/create`

```json
{
    "issuerId": "<YOUR_ISSUER_ID>",
    "data": {
        "name": {
            "legal_name": "Zach McKinnon",
            "first_name": "Zach",
            "last_name": "McKinnon"
        },
        "issuer_assigned_id": "",
        "stakeholder_type": "INDIVIDUAL",
        "current_relationship": "INVESTOR",
        "primary_contact": {
            "name": {
                "legal_name": "Zach McKinnon",
                "first_name": "Zach",
                "last_name": "McKinnon"
            },
            "emails": [
                {

            ],
            "phone_numbers": [

                    "phone_type": "MOBILE",
                    "phone_number": "+1 555-555-555"
                }
            ]
        },
        "contact_info": {
            "emails": [
                {
                    "email_type": "BUSINESS",
                    "email_address": "zachary@plume.org"
                }
            ],
            "phone_numbers": [
                {
                    "phone_type": "MOBILE",
                    "phone_number": "+1 555-555-555"
                }
            ]
        },
        "comments": []
    }
