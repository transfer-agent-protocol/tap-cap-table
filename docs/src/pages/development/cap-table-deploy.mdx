# Deploy a Cap Table

With the server running, you can create your first cap table via the API. This deploys a new cap table contract through the factory and creates an issuer record.

<Steps>

### Create an issuer via POST request

Using Postman or curl, send a POST request to `http://localhost:8293/issuer/create`:

```json
{
    "legal_name": "Transfer Agent Protocol",
    "formation_date": "2022-08-23",
    "country_of_formation": "US",
    "country_subdivision_of_formation": "DE",
    "initial_shares_authorized": "10000000",
    "tax_ids": [
        {
            "tax_id": "88-3977591",
            "country": "US"
        }
    ],
    "email": {
        "email_address": "dev@transferagentprotocol.xyz",
        "email_type": "BUSINESS"
    },
    "address": {
        "address_type": "LEGAL",
        "street_suite": "447 Broadway\n2nd Fl #713",
        "city": "New York",
        "country_subdivision": "NY",
        "country": "US",
        "postal_code": "10013"
    },
    "comments": []
}
```

All fields are validated against the [OCF schema](https://github.com/Open-Cap-Table-Coalition/Open-Cap-Format-OCF).

### Check the response

The response includes the `capTableAddress` - this is your new cap table contract deployed on-chain:

</Steps>

<Callout type="success">
Congratulations! You've deployed your first cap table smart contract.
</Callout>

## What's next?

With your cap table deployed, you can:
- Create stakeholders via `POST /stakeholder/create`
- Create stock classes via `POST /stock-class/create`
- Issue stock via `POST /transactions/stock/issuance`
