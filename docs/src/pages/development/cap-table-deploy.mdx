# Cap table smart contract

The cap table smart contract is responsible for minting the inital cap table onchain can be found in our repo under [CapTable.sol](https://github.com/transfer-agent-protocol/tap-cap-table/blob/main/chain/src/CapTable.sol).

## Deploy cap table smart contract
<Steps>

### Run the server

In the root folder, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Open Postman, and create a new POST request

Create a new request in Postman, and set the request type to `POST`. In the URL field, enter `http://localhost:{{PORT}}/issuer/create` - your port should be `8293` if you haven't changed it.

### Set the request body

In the request body, use this example JSON. You can change anything you like here. Every field is required and will first run through validation against the OCF schema using our [validateInputAgainstSchema](https://github.com/transfer-agent-protocol/tap-cap-table/blob/main/src/utils/validateInputAgainstSchema.js) script.
