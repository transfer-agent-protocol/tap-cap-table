# Run the Server

The Node.js server provides the REST API for managing cap tables. It connects to MongoDB for storage and to the blockchain for on-chain operations.

## Development mode

<Steps>

### Start the server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs the server with hot-reloading and the **event poller** enabled.

### Verify it's running

```bash
curl http://localhost:8293/
```

You should see a response confirming the server is up.

</Steps>

## What is the event poller?

The event poller watches the blockchain for contract events (like stock issuances, transfers, etc.) and syncs them to MongoDB. This keeps your off-chain database in sync with on-chain state.

- **`pnpm dev`** - Server with event poller (recommended for development)
- **`pnpm prod`** - Server without event poller
- **`pnpm prod-poller`** - Standalone event poller only (for production, processes finalized blocks)

<Callout type="info">
For local development, use `pnpm dev` which includes the poller. In production, you'd typically run the server and poller as separate processes.
</Callout>

## Next steps

With the server running, you can [deploy your first cap table](/development/cap-table-deploy) using the API.
