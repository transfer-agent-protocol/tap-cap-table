# Stakeholder Routes

<Callout type="info">
**Terminology Note**: TAP follows the Open Cap Format (OCF) standard which uses "stakeholder" to refer specifically to **equity holders on the cap table**—individuals (founders, employees, advisors) and institutions (VCs, investors) who own shares of the issuer. This is distinct from the broader business term "stakeholder" which can include any party with interest in a company (customers, partners, etc.).

One of the most interesting and important routes - given the `issuerId`, stakeholders can be added to the cap table.
