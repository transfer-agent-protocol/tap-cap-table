# Factory Routes

The factory is the entry point for deploying and tracking cap table contracts. Once a `CapTableFactory` is deployed, its address and the underlying implementation address need to be registered with the server so it can track new cap tables.

## `factory/register`

- **Description**: Registers the factory and implementation contract addresses in the database. This is called after deploying the `CapTableFactory` contract so the server knows where to look for new cap table creation events.
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Parameters** (body):
  - `factory_address`: The deployed CapTableFactory contract address (string).
  - `implementation_address`: The CapTable implementation contract address used by the beacon (string).

    "factory_address": "<YOUR_FACTORY_ADDRESS>",
    "implementation_address": "<YOUR_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS>"
