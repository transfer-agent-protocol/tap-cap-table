# Learn TAP

<Callout emoji="🫡">This doc has been recently updated</Callout>

TAP's smart contracts are designed to be modular. You can interact with them directly or via an API. The protocol is designed to be upgradable, supporting creation of new cap tables, as well as the ability to upgrade existing ones. To learn how this works, you should start with the [Open Cap Table Format](/protocol/tap-ocf) and then move on to the [Onchain Cap Table](/protocol/tap-cap-table).
