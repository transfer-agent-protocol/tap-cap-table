## Guide

If you see something you want to work on, please keep in mind:

- Never commit directly to `main` or `dev` branches
- Always checkout a new branch from `dev`
- Always keep `dev` up to date and stable (i.e. working without critical failures)
- When you're done and ready to merge your code, open a pull request from your branch to `dev`
