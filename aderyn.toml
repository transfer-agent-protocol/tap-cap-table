# Read the description carefully and uncomment the examples in each paragraph should you consider using them.

# Base path for resolving remappings and compiling smart contracts, relative to workspace-root (directory in which the editor is open)
# Most of the time, you want to point it to the directory containing foundry.toml or hardhat.config.js/ts.
root = "chain"

# Path of source directory containing the contracts, relative to root (above)
# Aderyn will traverse all the nested files inside to scan and report vulnerabilities found inside.
# If not specified, Aderyn will try to extract it from the framework that is being used.
# Set a sensible default for this repo:
src = "src/"

# Path segments of contract files to include in the analysis.
# - It can be a partial match like "/interfaces/", which will include all files with "/interfaces/" in the file path.
#   Or it can be a full match like "src/counters/Counter.sol", which will include only the file with the exact path.
# - If not specified, all contract files in the source directory will be included.
# Examples:
# include = ["src/counters/Counter.sol", "src/others/"]
# include = ["/interfaces/"]

# Path segments of contract files to exclude in the analysis.
# Provide basic excludes for tests and scripts so analysis focuses on contracts.
exclude = ["/test/", "/script/"]

# For advanced use cases, leverage the following

# Remappings 
# - It can be specified in `remappings.txt` within the root folder of the project.
# - If not specified, Aderyn will try to derive the values from foundry.toml (if present.)

# Environment
# - These are usually all the FOUNDRY_, DAPP_ environment variables that are used during development.
# - For example, if different profiles have different `src` declaration in `foundry.toml`, FOUNDRY_PROFILE can dictate the correct `src` value.
#   Env variables and their values can be specified below.

[env]
# Example:
# FOUNDRY_PROFILE = "default"
